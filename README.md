<h1>Uber Trips Analysis</h1>

- streamlit run second_app.py

NB:
- There is the bi-directional component in a comment that we see at the top of the app, it works but disables the rest of the app to display (WebServor error)
- Expanders are printed twice for each option when I started logging the execution time of the associated functions. Hence I can't remember which file 
is required.
